## Always remember
1.  Disable `PDO error` and `php display errors` in production mode.
2.  secure your config directory `app/config/` with Chmod  
`700 [rwx------]` writable by owner, readable by owner (most secure, if it works)  
`750 [rwxr-x---]` writable by owner, readable by owner and group  
`755 [rwxr-xr-x]` writable by owner, readable by all (details)  
`770 [rwxrwx---]` writable by owner and group, readable by owner and group  
`775 [rwxrwxr-x]` writable by owner and group, readable by all  
`777 [rwxrwxrwx]` writable by all, readable by all (not secure, details)  

3.  secure your config files `app/config/` with Chmod  
Recommend settings if you don't need write access:  
`400 [r--------]` readable by owner (most secure, if it works)  
`440 [r--r-----]` readable by owner and group (if 400 doesn't work)  
Recommended settings if you need write access:  
`600 [rw-------]` readable and writable by owner (most secure, if it works)  
`640 [rw-r-----]` readable and writable by owner, readable to group  
`660 [rw-rw----]` readable and writable by owner and group

`444 [r--r--r--]` readable by all  
`644 [rw-r--r--]` readable by all, writable to owner  
`664 [rw-rw-r--]` readable by all, writable to owner and group
